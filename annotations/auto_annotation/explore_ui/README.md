# Measurement Explorer UI Setup

## Setup
- run `poetry install` from the `modeltune/annotations/auto_annotation` dir
- cd to `modeltune/annotations/auto_annotations` dir
- run `poetry run streamlit run explore_ui/explore_ui.py`

## Measurement run usage
- Upload the `test_results_config.json` artifacts produces by measurement runs to begin exploring
- NOTE: Not all the old `test_result_config.json` artifacts will be compatible. Specifically, any of those that are created or uploaded prior to 11/1/2024 are highly likely incompatible.
